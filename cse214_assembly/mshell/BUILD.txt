'$' prefixed lines means you are typing in a Terminal [xterm, etc.]

To build the shell, type
$ make

After doing that, send me a mail saying "MiniSHELL Built"
See 'AUTHORS' file for email address.

To run the program, type the following in your terminal:
$ ./shell

A shell prompt will arrive. Type 'help' to see a brief summary of commands.
To exit from the shell, type 'exit' or press 'Ctrl-d'.

Requirements:
  as (I used GNU Assembler)
  ld (I used GNU Linker)
  make (I used GNU Make)

To remove unnecessary object files (*.o) do:
$ make clean
To remove executable and object files (*.o) do:
$ make distclean

To provide your own help, just modify the 'help' file in the current
directory. Help information is read from this file.

Note:
	'ls' command by default displays current directory in long listing.
	'ls' can list only directories.
	No command takes extra option argument (I didn't get much time for
	that).
	If you use 'ls <dir>', you must supply a terminting '/' after the
	directory. I just append the filename after the directory names.
	For example, you should use 'ls /tmp/' and not 'ls /tmp'.

Please read 'README' before running the program.
