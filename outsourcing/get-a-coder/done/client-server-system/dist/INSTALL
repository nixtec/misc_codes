Linux Environment:

Requirements:
1. gcc
2. POSIX Threads [pthreads] library [-lpthread]
3. GNU Cryptographic Library [-lcrypt]

Compiling:
1. make

Running:
1. In two terminals, run './server' and './shell'. See 'commands.txt' for
   available commands to be recognized from shell.


Windows Environment:

Requirements:
1. Dev-Cpp or GCC For Windows [mingw]

[Gmail doesn't allow attaching executable/bat files. So '_' is appended]
Compiling:
1. Rename 'cmdenv.bat_' to 'cmdenv.bat'
2. Check the Dev-Cpp 'bin' path in the 'cmdenv.bat' file and modify if needed
3. Run 'cmdenv.bat'
4. Rename 'build.win32.bat_' to 'build.win32.bat'
5. In 'cmdenv.bat' shell type 'build.win32.bat'

Running:
1. In two terminals [cmd windows], run 'server' and 'shell'. See 'commands.txt'
   for available commands to be recognized from shell.
2. When using 'execute' command from Windows shell if you don't see the command
   prompt after execution is done, type Ctrl-Z followed by ENTER. This is
   because of using an additional thread for input in windows.
