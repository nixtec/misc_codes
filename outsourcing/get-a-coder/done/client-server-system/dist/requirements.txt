Hi Mr Ayub,
I need of definitive version of project please, and I need that:

- I need of the pipe version of project
- I have seen that you use "pthread" in windows, but I prefer that you use native windows threads.
- you resolve the problem of the working directory if two shell are connected to the same server
- you create lock to avoid that 2 shells writes the same file
- I controlled the situation in which there is a linux client and a windows client the tranfer (with copy and move commands) of file from client to server don't work. Resolve this please.

I remember to you that I requested this project by january, but you postponed. So I requested it by the end of january, and than for the middle of february...now we are in middle of march!!

If you think that you are not capable to terminate this project, please send me the contact of some your collaborator for terminate it.
