Hello
   Here's the definitive project. First try all the features differently for
   two platforms. Then try cross-platform. I didn't test cross-platform. So
   inform if any errors and with screenshot if possible.

STEPS:
  Linux Version:
     * unzip the project
     * In terminal, type 'make'
     * In two different terminals run, './server' and './shell'

  Windows Version:
     * unzip the project
     * Rename 'build.win32.bat_' to 'build.win32.bat' and
       'cmdenv.bat_' to 'cmdenv.bat' [gmail doesn't allow sending executables]
     * Fix the 'Dev-Cpp' path in the 'cmdenv.bat' file. I used 'E:\Dev-Cpp\bin'
     * Run 'cmdenv.bat' [extension may be hidden in ur system]
     * In the command prompt type, 'build.win32.bat'. It should build the
       project.
     * In two different terminals run 'server.exe' and 'shell.exe'

NOTE:
   If you need to use lock anywhere, do it at your own way please. I have given
   all the implementation of pthread wrapper functions using Windows APIs. So
   that in the main code very little have to be modified. For anything to
   understand feel free to ask.

Thanks
