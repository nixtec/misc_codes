  Encryption and Password Handling</a>
      </h1>

  <p>On many systems, it is unnecessary to have any kind of user
  authentication; for instance, a workstation which is not
  connected to a network probably does not need any user
  authentication, because to use the machine an intruder must have
  physical access.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, however, it is necessary to be sure that a user is
  authorised to use some service a machine provides--for instance,
  to log in as a particular user id (see section
  <a href="http://docs.mandragor.org/files/Programming_languages/C/glibc-2.2.3/libc_29.html#SEC602">Users and Groups</a>). One
  traditional way of doing this is for each user to choose a secret
  <strong>password</strong>; then, the system can ask someone
  claiming to be a user what the user's password is, and if the
  person gives the correct password then the system can grant the
  appropriate privileges.</p>

  <p>If all the passwords are just stored in a file somewhere, then
  this file has to be very carefully protected. To avoid this,
  passwords are run through a <strong>one-way function</strong>, a
  function which makes it difficult to work out what its input was
  by looking at its output, before storing in the file.</p>

  <p>The GNU C library already provides a one-way function based on
  MD5 and for compatibility with Unix systems the standard one-way
  function based on the Data Encryption Standard.</p>

  <p>It also provides support for Secure RPC, and some library
  functions that can be used to perform normal DES encryption.</p>

      </h2>

  <p>Because of the continuously changing state of the law, it's
  not possible to provide a definitive survey of the laws affecting
  cryptography. Instead, this section warns you of some of the
  known trouble spots; this may help you when you try to find out
  what the laws of your country are.</p>

  <p>Some countries require that you have a licence to use, posess,
  or import cryptography. These countries are believed to include
  Byelorussia, Burma, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan,
  Pakistan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

  <p>Some countries restrict the transmission of encrypted messages
  by radio; some telecommunications carriers restrict the
  transmission of encrypted messages over their network.</p>

  <p>Many countries have some form of export control for encryption
  software. The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral agreement
  between 33 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
  Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
  Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the
  Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic
  of Korea, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic,
  Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom
  and the United States) which restricts some kinds of encryption
  exports. Different countries apply the arrangement in different
  ways; some do not allow the exception for certain kinds of
  "public domain" software (which would include this library), some
  only restrict the export of software in tangible form, and others
  impose significant additional restrictions.</p>

  <p>The United States has additional rules. This software would
  generally be exportable under 15 CFR 740.13(e), which permits
  exports of "encryption source code" which is "publicly available"
  and which is "not subject to an express agreement for the payment
  of a licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale
  of any product developed with the source code" to most
  countries.</p>

  <p>The rules in this area are continuously changing. If you know
  of any information in this manual that is out-of-date, please
  report it using the <code>glibcbug</code> script. See section
  <a href="http://docs.mandragor.org/files/Programming_languages/C/glibc-2.2.3/libc_36.html#SEC694">Reporting Bugs</a>.</p>

      </h2>

  <p>When reading in a password, it is desirable to avoid
  displaying it on the screen, to help keep it secret. The
  following function handles this in a convenient way.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
          <u>Function:</u> char * <b>getpass</b> <i>(const char
    *<var>prompt</var>)</i>
        </dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="IDX3639" id="IDX3639"></a> <br>
      <br>
       

      <p>
            <code>getpass</code> outputs <var>prompt</var>, then reads
      a string in from the terminal without echoing it. It tries to
      connect to the real terminal, <tt>`/dev/tty'</tt>, if
      possible, to encourage users not to put plaintext passwords
      in files; otherwise, it uses <code>stdin</code> and
      <code>stderr</code>. <code>getpass</code> also disables the
      INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters on the terminal using the
      <code>ISIG</code> terminal attribute (see section
      <a href="http://docs.mandragor.org/files/Programming_languages/C/glibc-2.2.3/libc_17.html#SEC364">Local Modes</a>). The terminal
      is flushed before and after <code>getpass</code>, so that
      characters of a mistyped password are not accidentally
      visible.</p>

      <p>In other C libraries, <code>getpass</code> may only return
      the first <code>PASS_MAX</code> bytes of a password. The GNU
      C library has no limit, so <code>PASS_MAX</code> is
      undefined.</p>

      <p>The prototype for this function is in <tt>`unistd.h'</tt>.
      <code>PASS_MAX</code> would be defined in
      <tt>`limits.h'</tt>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
      <br>
  <br>
   

  <p>This precise set of operations may not suit all possible
  situations. In this case, it is recommended that users write
  their own <code>getpass</code> substitute. For instance, a very
  simple substitute is as follows:</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">#include &lt;termios.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

ssize_t
my_getpass (char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
{
  struct termios old, new;
  int nread;

  /* Turn echoing off and fail if we can't. */
  if (tcgetattr (fileno (stream), &amp;old) != 0)
    return -1;
  new = old;
  new.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;
  if (tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &amp;new) != 0)
    return -1;
  
  /* Read the password. */
  nread = getline (lineptr, n, stream);

  /* Restore terminal. */
  (void) tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &amp;old);
  
  return nread;
}
</pre>

  <p>The substitute takes the same parameters as
  <code>getline</code> (see section
  <a href="http://docs.mandragor.org/files/Programming_languages/C/glibc-2.2.3/libc_12.html#SEC184">Line-Oriented Input</a>); the user
  must print any prompt desired.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
          <u>Function:</u> char * <b>crypt</b> <i>(const char
    *<var>key</var>, const char *<var>salt</var>)</i>

      <p>The <code>crypt</code> function takes a password,
      <var>key</var>, as a string, and a <var>salt</var> character
      array which is described below, and returns a printable ASCII
      string which starts with another salt. It is believed that,
      given the output of the function, the best way to find a
      <var>key</var> that will produce that output is to guess
      values of <var>key</var> until the original value of
      <var>key</var> is found.</p>

      <p>The <var>salt</var> parameter does two things. Firstly, it
      selects which algorithm is used, the MD5-based one or the
      DES-based one. Secondly, it makes life harder for someone
      trying to guess passwords against a file containing many
      passwords; without a <var>salt</var>, an intruder can make a
      guess, run <code>crypt</code> on it once, and compare the
      result with all the passwords. With a <var>salt</var>, the
      intruder must run <code>crypt</code> once for each different
      salt.</p>

      <p>For the MD5-based algorithm, the <var>salt</var> should
      consist of the string <code>$1$</code>, followed by up to 8
      characters, terminated by either another <code>$</code> or
      the end of the string. The result of <code>crypt</code> will
      be the <var>salt</var>, followed by a <code>$</code> if the
      salt didn't end with one, followed by 22 characters from the
      alphabet <code>./0-9A-Za-z</code>, up to 34 characters total.
      Every character in the <var>key</var> is significant.</p>

      <p>For the DES-based algorithm, the <var>salt</var> should
      consist of two characters from the alphabet
      <code>./0-9A-Za-z</code>, and the result of
      <code>crypt</code> will be those two characters followed by
      11 more from the same alphabet, 13 in total. Only the first 8
      characters in the <var>key</var> are significant.</p>

      <p>The MD5-based algorithm has no limit on the useful length
      of the password used, and is slightly more secure. It is
      therefore preferred over the DES-based algorithm.</p>

      <p>When the user enters their password for the first time,
      the <var>salt</var> should be set to a new string which is
      reasonably random. To verify a password against the result of
      a previous call to <code>crypt</code>, pass the result of the
      previous call as the <var>salt</var>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
      <br>
  <br>
   

  <p>The following short program is an example of how to use
  <code>crypt</code> the first time a password is entered. Note
  that the <var>salt</var> generation is just barely acceptable; in
  particular, it is not unique between machines, and in many
  applications it would not be acceptable to let an attacker know
  what time the user's password was last set.</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;crypt.h&gt;

int 
main(void)
{
  unsigned long seed[2];
  char salt[] = "$1$........";
  const char *const seedchars = 
    "./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST"
    "UVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  char *password;
  int i;
  
  /* Generate a (not very) random seed.  
     You should do it better than this... */
  seed[0] = time(NULL);
  seed[1] = getpid() ^ (seed[0] &gt;&gt; 14 &amp; 0x30000);
  
  /* Turn it into printable characters from `seedchars'. */
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
    salt[3+i] = seedchars[(seed[i/5] &gt;&gt; (i%5)*6) &amp; 0x3f];
  
  /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it. */
  password = crypt(getpass("Password:"), salt);
  
  /* Print the results. */
  puts(password);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

  <p>The next program shows how to verify a password. It prompts
  the user for a password and prints "Access granted." if the user
  types <code>GNU libc manual</code>.</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  char *result;
  int ok;
  
  /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it,
     passing the expected password in as the salt. */
  result = crypt(getpass("Password:"), pass);

  /* Test the result. */
  ok = strcmp (result, pass) == 0;

  return ok ? 0 : 1;

      <p>The <code>crypt_r</code> function does the same thing as
      <code>crypt</code>, but takes an extra parameter which
      includes space for its result (among other things), so it can
      be reentrant. <code>data-&gt;initialized</code> must be
      cleared to zero before the first time <code>crypt_r</code> is
      called.</p>

  Encryption</a>
      </h2>

  <p>The Data Encryption Standard is described in the US Government
  Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 46-3 published by
  the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The DES has
  been very thoroughly analysed since it was developed in the late
  1970s, and no new significant flaws have been found.</p>

  <p>However, the DES uses only a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits),
  and a machine has been built in 1998 which can search through all
  possible keys in about 6 days, which cost about US$200000; faster
  searches would be possible with more money. This makes simple DES
  unsecure for most purposes, and NIST no longer permits new US
  government systems to use simple DES.</p>

  <p>For serious encryption functionality, it is recommended that
  one of the many free encryption libraries be used instead of
  these routines.</p>

  <p>The DES is a reversible operation which takes a 64-bit block
  and a 64-bit key, and produces another 64-bit block. Usually the
  bits are numbered so that the most-significant bit, the first
  bit, of each block is numbered 1.</p>

  <p>Under that numbering, every 8th bit of the key (the 8th, 16th,
  and so on) is not used by the encryption algorithm itself. But
  the key must have odd parity; that is, out of bits 1 through 8,
  and 9 through 16, and so on, there must be an odd number of `1'
  bits, and this completely specifies the unused bits.</p>

  <dl>

      <a name="IDX3642" id="IDX3642"></a> <br>
      <br>
       

      <p>The <code>setkey</code> function sets an internal data
      structure to be an expanded form of <var>key</var>.
      <var>key</var> is specified as an array of 64 bits each
      stored in a <code>char</code>, the first bit is
      <code>key[0]</code> and the 64th bit is <code>key[63]</code>.
      The <var>key</var> should have the correct parity.</p>

      <a name="IDX3643" id="IDX3643"></a> <br>

      <p>The <code>encrypt</code> function encrypts
      <var>block</var> if <var>edflag</var> is 0, otherwise it
      decrypts <var>block</var>, using a key previously set by
      <code>setkey</code>. The result is placed in
      <var>block</var>.</p>

      <p>Like <code>setkey</code>, <var>block</var> is specified as
      an array of 64 bits each stored in a <code>char</code>, but
      there are no parity bits in <var>block</var>.</p>

  <p>The <code>setkey_r</code> and <code>encrypt_r</code> functions

      <p>The function <code>ecb_crypt</code> encrypts or decrypts
      one or more blocks using DES. Each block is encrypted
      independently.</p>

      <p>The <var>blocks</var> and the <var>key</var> are stored
      packed in 8-bit bytes, so that the first bit of the key is
      the most-significant bit of <code>key[0]</code> and the 63rd
      bit of the key is stored as the least-significant bit of
      <code>key[7]</code>. The <var>key</var> should have the
      correct parity.</p>

      <p>
            <var>len</var> is the number of bytes in
      <var>blocks</var>. It should be a multiple of 8 (so that
      there is a whole number of blocks to encrypt). <var>len</var>
      is limited to a maximum of <code>DES_MAXDATA</code>
      bytes.</p>

      <p>The result of the encryption replaces the input in

      <p>The function <code>cbc_crypt</code> encrypts or decrypts
      one or more blocks using DES in Cipher Block Chaining
      mode.</p>

      <p>For encryption in CBC mode, each block is exclusive-ored
      with <var>ivec</var> before being encrypted, then
      <var>ivec</var> is replaced with the result of the
      encryption, then the next block is processed. Decryption is
      the reverse of this process.</p>

      <p>This has the advantage that blocks which are the same
      before being encrypted are very unlikely to be the same after
      being encrypted, making it much harder to detect patterns in
      the data.</p>

      <p>Usually, <var>ivec</var> is set to 8 random bytes before
      encryption starts. Then the 8 random bytes are transmitted
      along with the encrypted data (without themselves being
      encrypted), and passed back in as <var>ivec</var> for
      decryption. Another possibility is to set <var>ivec</var> to
      8 zeroes initially, and have the first the block encrypted
      consist of 8 random bytes.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, all the parameters are similar to those for
      <code>ecb_crypt</code>.</p>

      <p>The function <code>des_setparity</code> changes the 64-bit
      <var>key</var>, stored packed in 8-bit bytes, to have odd
      parity by altering the low bits of each byte.</p>
