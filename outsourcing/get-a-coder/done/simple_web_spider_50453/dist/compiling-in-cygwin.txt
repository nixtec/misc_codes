Follow the steps to compile the project in Cygwin [in Windows]:

I assume you installed 'cygwin' in C:\cygwin. If another location used, then
change 'C:\cygwin' to that location in the following text.

1. Copy the attached source code archive 'myspider-1.0.tar.gz' to
      C:\cygwin\home\munazip
2. Copy the attached 'w3c-libwww-5.4.0-1.tar.bz2' to
      C:\cygwin\home\munazip
3. Open the 'cygwin' shell. As you sent me screenshot of it.
4. Extract the files from source archive with the following command, in cygwin:
      tar -xzf myspider-1.0.tar.gz
5. Extract the files from 'w3c-libwww-5.4.0-1.tar.bz2' with following command:
      tar -C / -xjf w3c-libwww-5.4.0-1.tar.bz2
6. Now change to the extracted source directory with following command:
      cd myspider-1.0
7. To compile the project, type the following:
      make -f Makefile.cygwin
   You will see some commands are executing after you press ENTER after above
   If no error message is displayed, the compilation finished successfully.
   For sure that the executable is generated, type:
      ls myspider.exe
   If you see its name, then compilation was successful!
8. To execute the program, type the following:
      ./myspider http://www.brad.ac.uk/internal/


   Remember that the spider by default crawls the whole site starting with
   the given link, so if there are 10000 pages, the matrix will be 10000x10000
   and it may take much memory because all the visited links are put in
   binary-search-tree to be sure that we don't visit the same page twice or the
   spider doesn't fall into infinite loop in crawling.
   So, this is always better to set some limited number of pages to visit. For
   example, to get a 25x25 matrix, you'll execute the spider as following:
      ./myspider http://www.brad.ac.uk/internal/ 25

   That's it. I gave you screenshot for 20x20 matrix.

   Wish your success in the compiling the project.
