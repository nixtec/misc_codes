Description:

Create an operating system that manages a remote network file server and mail
depository. Your server should be protected, allowing access only to those users with
permission to use it. Only those files and e-mails associated with a particular user can be
accessed by that user.
Your server’s system must contain an interface that receives files, data, and mail. The
interface will also give out mail, data blocks, and file information (as appropriate).
Obviously, the security element will tie into this interface.
Your server will also contain a file manager, a mail manager, and a communication
controller. The communication controller manages its interaction with the network.
Your server will receive process requests, some which will require output. Such requests
will only be accepted after a successful security check. Therefore, the first request must
be an access request. No access will be granted without a valid userid and password.
Once security is approved, the server will establish a communication pipeline with the
requestor, facilitating further requests. The final request will be one that closes the pipe.
