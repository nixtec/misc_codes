\f0\fs26 \cf0 Hey Ayub,\
\
Here is some feedback on some changes that would be needed apart from the loop that needs to be maintained for the server.\
\
1) The download part was not working, i could not move files from the server to the client.\
It gave me an error saying that file did not exist. Upload works fine\
\
2) I have a small request with the implementation of the file uploads and the downloads, i know you don't like to hear changes once you have finished coding but i was wondering if for upload and download we could use a temp directory.\
This is how it would work, suppose we are sending from client({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.5/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.5}}) to server({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1}}). First file moves to a temp directory inside the folder 192.168.0.5({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.5/temp"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.5/temp}}), than we move it to a folder called pipeline which is outside the folder {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.169.0.5/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.169.0.5}}, from here it finally moves to the temp folder inside the server folder which is 192.168.0.1({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/temp"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1/temp}}) and than finally the file moves to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1}}\
For upload:\
192.168.0.5->{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.5/temp-"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.5/temp-}}>Pipeline->{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/temp-"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1/temp-}}>{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1}}\
For download:\
192.168.0.1->{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.1/temp-"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.1/temp-}}>Pipeline->{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.5/temp-"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.5/temp-}}>{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://192.168.0.5/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 192.168.0.5}}\
\
The initial transfer from the client's computer into the temp folder for the client will be a copy, other than that every transfer should be a move\
And once file transfer is done there should be no files left in the temp and the Pipeline.\
Also i was thinking it would be a good idea to keep the .fifo file within the temp folders for the client and server.\
I think it will not be a big deal to implement as it would only involve moving the file around to other places before finally going to destination directory. I would really appreciate it if you could do this by tomorrow.\
\
Thanks Ayub\
