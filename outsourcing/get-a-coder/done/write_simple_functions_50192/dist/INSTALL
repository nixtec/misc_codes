==INSTALL==

In UNIX:
1. Open a terminal. Go to the directory where the archive is
2. Extract the archive
   tar -xzf dsfuncs-1.0.tar.gz
3. Change to the extracted directory
   cd dsfuncs-1.0
4. Build the program
   make
5. Run the program
   ./dsfuncs

In Windows [Turbo C for Windows]:
1. Copy 'dsfuncs.c' and 'dsfuncs.h' to 'C:\TCWIN\BIN'
   [assuming tcwin is installed in C:\]
2. Run 'tcwin'
3. From 'File->Open' menu, select the 'dsfuncs.c' file [filter *.c]
4. Compile it, Build it. Run it.

I provided screenshots for both Linux and Windows desktops. Wish that will be
helpful.


See README file for the syntax of the input [file].
