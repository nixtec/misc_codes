Hello ,
 
          I have a problem with the code. The thing is i have to change the secid datatype from int to char array which can store the input information like below.
 
Sec5 - Input string
Sec6 - Output(Initailly blank) string or int
Sec2 - Operations string
Sec3 - Some information string
 
 
One more thing, We are maintianing a queue for length, right. I should have one more queue as running queue, when new job comes in, it is first put in the queue which you have already created, after sometime(put dummy if conditon)
if(transfer=="yes"){
    you have to transfer the information to the running queue
}.
 
Put one more if condition
if(complete=="yes"){
      sec6=result;
      section id's information are transfered back to where yuo got.
}
