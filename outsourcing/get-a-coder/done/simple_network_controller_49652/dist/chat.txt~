I have accepted your bid and just like all your other clients expect the best
from you. Your bid price was more then my budget but that's fine as long as
you do a good job and do it within three days.

A sample output of the program would be something like this:
Port #1: Active, Processes# 01, 12, 18, 25

This program is really important to me and i am counting on you guys to do it
within 3 days.
I would also appreciate it if you could submit a Readme file and a design
document describing your design approach(either a flowchart or just a word
document with text).

Keep me posted on the progress.

If all goes well i should have some more programs for you towards the end of this month.

Thanks
Freesmile
