mkdir -p /dev/usb
mknod /dev/usb/hiddev0 c 180 96

When done, you may delete the /dev/usb directory because it was not
pre-existing.

But it's not necessary since it's not being used by others. So it's not
harmful.

rm -rf /dev/usb		[optional]


Latest kernels automatically initialize /dev filesystem. So, anything new
created manually won't be saved between sessions.
