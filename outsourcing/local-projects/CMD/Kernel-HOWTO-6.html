<h2><a name="s6">6. Patching the kernel </a></h2>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.1">6.1 Applying a patch </a>
</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Incremental upgrades of the kernel are distributed as patches. For
example, if you have version 1.1.45, and you notice that there's a
`<code>patch46.gz</code>' out there for it, it means you can upgrade to version
1.1.46 through application of the patch. You might want to make a backup of the
source tree first (`<code>make clean</code>' and then
`<code>cd /usr/src; tar zcvf old-tree.tar.gz linux</code>'
will make a compressed tar archive for you.).
</p><p>
</p><p>So, continuing with the example above, let's suppose that
you have `<code>patch46.gz</code>' in <code>/usr/src</code>. <code>cd</code> to
<code>/usr/src</code>  and do a `<code>zcat patch46.gz | patch -p0</code>'
(or `<code>patch -p0 &lt; patch46</code>'
if the patch isn't compressed). You'll see things whizz by
(or flutter by, if your
system is that slow) telling you that it is trying to apply hunks,
and whether it succeeds or not. Usually, this action goes by too quickly for
you to read, and you're not too sure whether it worked or not, so you might
want to use the <code>-s</code> flag to <code>patch</code>, which tells <code>patch</code>
to only report error messages (you don't get as much of the ``hey, my
computer is actually doing something for a change!'' feeling, but you may
prefer this..). To look for
parts which might not have gone smoothly, cd to <code>/usr/src/linux</code>  and
look for files with a <code>.rej</code> extension. Some versions of <code>patch</code>
(older versions which may have been compiled with on an inferior
filesystem) leave the rejects with a <code>#</code> extension. You can use
`<code>find</code>' to look for you;
</p><pre>    find .  -name '*.rej' -print
</pre>

prints all files who live in the current directory or any subdirectories with
a <code>.rej</code> extension to the standard output.
<p>
</p><p>If everything went right, do a `<code>make clean</code>', `<code>config</code>',
and `<code>dep</code>' as described in sections 3 and 4.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are quite a few options to the <code>patch</code> command. As mentioned
above, <code>patch -s</code>
will suppress all messages except the errors. If you keep your kernel
source in some other place than <code>/usr/src/linux</code>, <code>patch -p1</code>
(in that directory) will patch things cleanly. Other <code>patch</code> options are
well-documented in the manual page.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.2">6.2 If something goes wrong </a>
</h2>

<p>
</p><p>(Note: this section refers mostly to quite old kernels)
</p><p>
</p><p>The most frequent problem that used to arise was when a patch modified
a file called `<code>config.in</code>' and it didn't look quite right,
because you changed the options to suit your machine. This has been
taken care of, but one still might encounter it with an older release.
To fix it, look at the <code>config.in.rej</code>  file, and see what remains
of the original patch.
The changes will typically be marked with `<code>+</code>' and `<code>-</code>'
at the beginning of the
line. Look at the lines surrounding it, and remember if they were set to
`<code>y</code>' or `<code>n</code>'. Now, edit <code>config.in</code>, and change
`<code>y</code>' to `<code>n</code>' and `<code>n</code>' to `<code>y</code>'
when appropriate. Do a
</p><pre>    patch -p0 &lt; config.in.rej
</pre>

and if it reports that it
succeeded (no fails), then you can continue on with a configuration and
compilation. The <code>config.in.rej</code> file will remain, but you can get
delete it.
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter further problems, you might have installed a patch out
of order. If patch says `<code>previously applied patch detected: Assume
-R?</code>', you are probably trying to apply a patch which is below your current
version number; if you answer `<code>y</code>', it will attempt to degrade
your source, and will most likely fail; thus, you will need to get a whole new
source tree (which might not have been such a bad idea in the first place).
</p><p>
</p><p>To back out (unapply) a patch, use `<code>patch -R</code>' on the original patch.
</p><p>
</p><p>The best thing to do when patches really turn out wrong is to start over
again with a clean, out-of-the-box source tree (for example, from one
of the <code>linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</code>  files), and start again.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.3">6.3 Getting rid of the .orig files </a>
</h2>

<p>
</p><p>After just a few patches, the <code>.orig</code>  files will start to pile up. For
example, one 1.1.51 tree I had was once last cleaned out at 1.1.48.
Removing the .orig files saved over a half a meg.
</p><pre>    find .  -name '*.orig' -exec rm -f {} ';'
</pre>

will take care of it for you. Versions of <code>patch</code> which use
<code>#</code> for rejects use a tilde instead of <code>.orig</code>.
<p>There are better ways to get rid of the <code>.orig</code> files, which
depend on GNU <code>xargs</code>:
</p><pre>    find .  -name '*.orig' | xargs rm
</pre>

or the ``quite secure but a little more verbose'' method:
<pre>    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | xargs --null rm --
</pre>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.4">6.4 Other patches </a>
</h2>

<p>
</p><p>There are other patches (I'll call them ``nonstandard'') than the
ones Linus distributes. If you apply these, Linus' patches may not work
correctly and you'll have to either back them out, fix the source or
the patch, install a new source tree, or a combination of the above. This
can become very frustrating, so if you do not want to modify the source (with
the possibility of a very bad outcome), back
out the nonstandard patches before applying Linus', or just install a new
tree. Then, you can see
if the nonstandard patches still work. If they don't, you are either
stuck with an old kernel, playing with the patch or source to
get it to work, or waiting (possibly begging) for a new version of
the patch to come out.
</p><p>
</p><p>How common are the patches not in the standard distribution? You will
probably hear of them. I used to use the noblink patch 
for my virtual consoles because I hate blinking cursors (This patch
is (or at least was) frequently updated for new kernel releases.). With
most newer device drivers being developed as loadable modules, though, the
frequecy of ``nonstandard'' patches is decreasing significantly.
