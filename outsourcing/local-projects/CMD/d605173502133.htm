<font class="mainheadlink"><i>Online health check-up gains popularity</i></font><br>

<font class="byline">Dwaipayan Barua</font><br><br>
Computer Meridian Diagnostics (CMD), an internet-based computerised
health check-up system, is gaining popular in the port city. <p>The
system is capable to diagnose any illness and report on 12 main organs
of a human body such as heart, lungs, kidney, liver, gallbladder,
stomach, digestive system and pancreas within 20 seconds.</p><p></p><p>CMD
technology provides one with the analysis of the latest state of one's
health taking reading from skins of fingertips in a painless way,
specialists said.</p><p></p><p>They said the system makes a profile on
fitness and gives the measurement of energy level of 12 vital organs of
human body enabling one to take control of the health. </p><p>The
people in Chittagong came to know more about the technology when a
stall offered CMD check-up facilities at the three-day IT fair that
ended at the Agrabad Banani Complex in the city on Saturday.</p><p></p><p>Around 70 people received the CMD check-ups at the stall, sources said.</p><p></p><p>The
Bangladesh Softalk Online Private Limited, a Dhaka-based software firm,
was the first to launch the system in the country originated in Europe,
sources said. </p><p>At present 23 centres, including two in Chittagong, offer check-up through the technology in the country.</p><p></p><p>The two centres here have already generated a lot of interest among the people, particularly the young generation.</p><p></p><p>Preventive
Health Care was opened at Agrabad on March 26 last year while Advanced
Health Care started CMD check-up facilities at Jamal Khan in January
this year.</p><p></p><p>Around 1,000 patients have received the basic check-up at the two centres so far, sources said.</p><p></p><p>Prof
Dr Hasanuzzaman Bhuiyan, working at Preventive Health Care, said
scientists and researchers in China, Japan, Germany and Soviet Union
developed the CMD system after research of 35 years at Russian Space
Agency. </p><p>This system, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM), was first used for medical check-up of Russian astronauts, says
a website information. They proved the effectiveness of the system
staying in sound state of body and mind in the space station Mir for
long 11 years, said Prof Hasanuzzaman, also head of the Forensic
Medicine Department of Chittagong Medical College (CMC). </p><p>The
research for developing the he system was first started at the Russian
Space Agency in 1984. The objective was to develop a system to monitor
astronauts' health during prolonged stay in space flights. It also
aimed at envisaging ways to overcome the problem of retaining the
vitality and energy of the astronauts in weightlessness during a flight
of long duration. </p><p>A team of 400 scientists and technicians
directed by professor Dr V Zagriadskij developed CMD-Prognosis in
cooperation with Dr Valery Polyakov of the Institute for Biomedical
Problems, in Moscow. They conducted more than 1000 medical experiments
on astronauts abroad the Mir space station, using many types of test
equipment to formulate the system, says the website.</p><p></p><p>After
the collapse of USSR in 90s, Germany bought the technology from Russia
and conducted more research on it leading to the development of the CMD
system, said Prof Hasanuzzaman. </p><p>Dr Liton of Chittagong Medical
Centre said any illness of the body can be detected through tracing out
the imbalance in the body's energy system.</p><p></p><p>Any irregular
signal in human body can be detected by CMD system and measures are
taken accordingly for heeling, said Dr Liton, also works as a
specialist at Advanced Health Care.</p><p></p><p>Prof Hasanuzzaman
said, "We take measurements of the body's energy level using the unique
CMD sensor. The readings are sent via Internet to the central CMD
Server in Germany." They compare the data we send with those gathered
from persons of the same age, gender and various states of health, and
an evaluation report is made, he added. </p><p>Abu Taher, a student of
Chittagong College, said, "I was interested about this when I heard one
of my friend's uncle was able to learn about his diabetes through CMD
check-up and it was proved when he examined his sugar."</p><p>Prabir, a
Chittagong University student, said, "I was not aware of having my
peptic ulcer that was detected through CMD reading." </p><p>Several physicians of mainstream medical treatment also showed interest in this modern system of diagnosis.</p><p></p><p>Dr
Sushanta, a physician at Chittagong Maa O Shishu Hospital, said he was
interested in the system. But he could not afford to receive training
on it abroad.</p><p>
