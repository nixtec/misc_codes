Interfacing a bar code reader to a PC:

All application programs support bar code reading as long as you have the
right equipment. Bar code readers are available with two types of output -
either "keyboard wedge" output or RS232 output. The bar code readers with
keyboard wedge output plug directly into the keyboard port on your PC and they
also provide a pigtail connector so that you can plug in your keyboard at the
same time. When you scan a bar code with the keyboard wedge bar code reader,
the data goes into the computer just as if it were typed in on the keyboard.
This makes it extremely easy to interface the bar code reader to any
application that is written to accept keyboard data.


Drawbacks:
The keyboard wedge interface is extremely simple however it has a few
drawbacks. If you swipe a bar code, the cursor has to be in the correct input
field in the correct application, otherwise you end up reading bar code data
into whatever application has the focus. This can cause all sorts of potential
problems as you can imagine. The keyboard output also is limited in that you
cannot modify the data in any way before sending it into the program that is
to receive the data. For example, if you needed to parse a bar code message
into multiple pieces or remove some of a bar code message or add in a date or
time stamp you would not be able to with a normal keyboard wedge reader.
