    is some information that will give you a basic introduction to barcodes. If you need more
    details about particular barcodes, check out our page on <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/speclist.html">Different
    Types of Barcodes</a>. And we are always happy to answer questions; just give us a call or
    send us an e-mail message. </p>
    <p><font color="#0000ff"><big><strong>How does a barcode work?</strong> </big></font></p>
    <p>Each character is represented by a pattern of wide and narrow bars.<br>
    <img src="intro_files/how_it_works2" alt="how_it_works2.jpg (9825 bytes)" border="1" height="123" width="500"><br>
    A barcode reader uses a photosensor to convert the barcode into an electrical signal as it
    moves across a barcode.&nbsp; The scanner then measures the relative widths of the bars
    and spaces, translates the different patterns back into regular characters, and sends them
    on to a computer or portable terminal.</p>
    <p><img src="intro_files/how_it_works" alt="how_it_works.jpg (14454 bytes)" align="right" border="1" height="232" width="400">Every barcode begins with a special start character and ends with
    a special stop character. These codes help the reader detect the barcode and figure out
    whether it is being scanned forward or backward. </p>
    <p>Some barcodes may include a checksum character just before the stop character. A
    checksum is calculated when the barcode is printed using the characters in the barcode.
    The reader performs the same calculation and compares its answer to the checksum it read
    at the end of the barcode. If the two don't match, the reader assumes that something is
    wrong, throws out the data, and tries again. </p>
    <p>There are <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/speclist.html">different barcode symbologies</a>, each with
    its own particular pattern of bars. The <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/upc_a.html">UPC</a> code used on
    retail products is an all-numeric code; so is the <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/i2_of_5.html">Interleaved
    2 of 5 Code</a>. <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/code_39.html">Code 39</a> includes upper case letters,
    digits, and a few symbols. <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/code_128.html">Code 128</a> includes every
    printable and unprintable ASCII character code. </p>
    <p><big><font color="#0000ff"><strong>What's a 2-D code?</strong></font><font color="#ff0000"> </font></big></p>
    <p>2-Dimensional symbols are generally square or rectangular patterns that encode data in
    two dimensions.&nbsp; They fall into two general categories:&nbsp; 'Stacked barcodes' are
    constructed like a layer cake of barcodes stacked on on top of the other; they can be read
    by special 2-D scanners or by many CCD and laser scanners with the aid of special decoding
    software.&nbsp; 'Matrix Codes' are built on a true 2-D matrix; they are usually more
    compact than a stacked barcode, and they can be read only by a true 2-D scanner.&nbsp; The
    primary advantage of 2-D codes is the ability to encode a lot of information in a small
    space.&nbsp; The practical limit for a standard barcode depends on a number of factors,
    but 20 to 25 characters is an approximate maximum; 2-D symbols can encode from 100 to
    about 2,000 characters.&nbsp; The next time you receive a package from United Parcel
    Service look for a 1-inch square label with a pattern of dots and a small bullseye in the
    center. This is a <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/maxicode.html">MaxiCode</a> label, and it is used by
    UPS for automatic destination sortation.&nbsp; Two other popular 2-D codes are <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/pdf417.html">PDF-417</a> and <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/datamatx.html">DataMatrix</a>.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000ff"><big><strong>What barcode symbology should I use?</strong></big></font></p>
    <p>Are there any industry standards that your codes will have to conform to, or is an
    important customer insisting on a specific label format?&nbsp; If so, you will probably
    have to use whatever barcode they want.&nbsp; If you are marking a retail product, <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/upc_a.html">UPC-A</a> is the code used in the USA and <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/ean_13.html">EAN-13</a> is used in the rest of the world.&nbsp; If you are
    shipping containers to the U.S. Government you will need to adhere to the <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/logmars.html">LOGMARS</a> specification (which uses Code 39). If the
    application is strictly for internal use and you can choose anything you want, do you now
    or will you ever need to encode letters as well as numbers? If so, <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/code_39.html">Code 39</a> or <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/code_128.html">Code 128</a>
    would be a good choice. If you need only numbers, <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/i2_of_5.html">Interleaved
    2 of 5</a> would do the job although Code 128 tends to be more robust and just as compact
    for numeric data.&nbsp; If you have to encode a lot of data, take a look at <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/pdf417.html">PDF-417</a>.&nbsp; If you need to squeeze a small or modest
    amount of data into a really small space, then <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/datamatx.html">DataMatrix</a>
    might be a good choice.&nbsp; Depending on the details of your application there may be
    other codes to consider.&nbsp; If you need help deciding what type of code to use, <a href="mailto:info@makebarcode.com">send us an email</a>, fax us at 847-866-9836, or call
    us at 847-866-7940 (or 800-229-5794 in the USA); describe your requirements and we'll try
    to help.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#0000ff"><big><strong>How do I get a retail code for my new
    product?</strong></big></font></p>
    <p align="left">In the USA, the first thing you need to do is get a manufacturer's ID
    number which will uniquely identify your products. These numbers are managed by the
    Uniform Code Council in Dayton, Ohio. Contact them by telephone at 937-435-3870 or by fax
    at 937-435-4749; you can also visit their web site at <a href="http://www.uc-council.org/">http://www.uc-council.org</a>.
    Your manufacturer's ID number accounts for 5 digits of the UPC code, which leaves you 5
    digits to assign in any way you want. You will need to provide retail outlets with a list
    of your products and their assigned UPC codes so they can be entered in the cash register
    system. </p>
    <p align="left">If you are selling products outside the USA, you will probably need an <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/ean_13.html">EAN-13</a> code.&nbsp; These numbers are assigned by
    registration authorities in most countries; you can find the EAN authority for your area
    on our <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/stdorg/orgs.html">list of standards organizations</a>.&nbsp; You can
    also visit EAN World Headquarters in Belgium at <a href="http://www.ean.be/">http://www.ean.be</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">If you will be publishing books, you will need an ISBN number.&nbsp; Once
    you have this number, you can create an <a href="http://www.mecsw.com/specs/bookland.html">EAN-13 Bookland
    Code</a>. &nbsp; </p>
