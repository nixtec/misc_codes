      <p>Bar codes are like a printed version of the Morse code. Different bar 
        and space patterns are used to represent different characters. Sets of 
        these patterns are grouped together to form a "symbology". There 
        are many types of bar code symbologies each having their own special characteristics 
        and features. Most symbologies were designed to meet the needs of a specific 
        application or industry. For example the UPC symbology was designed for 
        identifying retail and grocery items and PostNET was designed to encode 
        Zip Codes for the US Postal Service.</p>
      <p>The following is a detailed description of the most commonly used bar
         code symbologies. All of the following types of bar codes are fully
        supported 
        by B-Coder Pro, the TALtech Bar Code ActiveX control and the TALtech
        Bar Code DLLs.</p>
      <p></p>

		  

          

			

            
      <h2>CODE 39<a name="CODE39"></a> (Normal and Full ASCII versions)</h2>

			

           

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/code39" height="50" width="156">

			

			<p>The Normal CODE 39 is a variable length

            symbology that can encode the following 44 characters:

            1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-. *$/+%. Code 39 is the most
			  popular symbology in the

            non-retail world and is used extensively in manufacturing, military,
			  and health

            applications. Each Code 39 bar code is framed by a start/stop character
			  represented by an

            asterisk (*). The Asterisk is reserved for this purpose and may not
			  be used in the body of

            a message. B-Coder automatically adds the start and stop character
			  to each bar code

            therefore you should not include them as part of your bar code message.
			  If you select the

            NORMAL version of CODE 39 and your bar code text contains lower case
			  characters, B-Coder

            will convert them to upper case. If your bar code message contains
			  any invalid characters,

            B-Coder will prompt you with a warning message (if the Enable Invalid
			  Warning Messages

            option is selected in the Preferences menu).</p>

			

			
            <p>Code 39 optionally allows for a (modulo 43) check character in cases 
        where data security is important. The health care industry has adopted 
        the use of this check character for health care applications. </p>

			

       

			

            <p>Another feature of Code 39 allows for concatenation of two or
              more bar codes. It is

            sometimes advantageous to break long messages into multiple shorter
              messages. If the

            first data character of a Code 39 symbol is a space, some readers
              will store the remainder

            of the symbol in a buffer

			and not transmit the data. This operation

            continues for all successive Code 39 symbols with a leading space,
              with each message

            appended to the previous one.</p>

			

			

            <p>When a message without a leading space is read, it is appended to the previously

            scanned data in the buffer and the entire buffer is transmitted as one long message.</p>

			

			<p>The FULL ASCII version of Code 39 is a modification of the NORMAL (standard)

            version that can encode the complete 128 ASCII character set (including
			  asterisks). The

            Full ASCII version is implemented by using the four characters: $/+%
			  as shift characters

            to change the meanings of the rest of the characters in the Normal
			  Code 39 character set.

            Because the Full ASCII version uses shift characters in combination
			  with other standard

            characters to represent data not in the Normal Code 39 character
			  set, each non-standard

            character requires twice the width of a standard character in a printed
			  symbol. </p>

			

          

			
            <p><i><b>Note: </b></i> Because all of the characters used to implement
               Full ASCII Code 39 are part of the Normal Code 39 character set,
              readers 
        that do not support Full ASCII Code 39 will still read Full ASCII Code
               39 symbols. The barcode reader will output shifted characters
              as if they were 
        normal Code 39 characters.</p>

      <h1> UPC<a name="UPC"></a>-A, UPC-E, and UPC Supplementals</h1>

			

          

			<h2>UPC-A with Supplemental UPC-E</h2>

		  

           

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/upc-a" height="50" width="172"><img src="bcsymbol_files/upc-e" height="50" width="83">

		  

            

			
      <p>UPC-A is a 12 digit, numeric symbology used in retail applications. UPC-A 
        symbols consist of 11 data digits and one check digit. The first digit 
        is a number system digit that normally represents the type of product 
        being identified. The following 5 digits are a manufacturers code and 
        the next 5 digits are used to identify a specific product.</p>

			

			<p>UPC numbers are

            assigned to specific products and manufacturers by the Uniform Code Council (UCC). To

            apply for a UPC number or for more information, you can contact the UCC at 8163 Old Yankee

            Road, Suite J, Dayton, OH 45458 Tel: 937-435-3870</p>

			

            
      <p>When specifying UPC-A messages, you normally specify 11 digits and let
         your bar code printing software calculate the 12th check digit for you.
        
        (All TALtech bar code software products automatically calculate check
        digits for you.)</p>

			

            
      <p>UPC-E is a smaller seven digit UPC symbology for number system 0. It 
        is often used for small retail items. For UPC-E bar codes, you normally 
        specify 6 digits and let your bar code printing software calculate the 
        seventh check digit for you. </p>
      <p>Both UPC-A and UPC-E allow for a supplemental two or five digit number 
        to be appended to the main bar code symbol. This supplemental message 
        was designed for use on publications and periodicals. If you enter a supplemental 
        message, it must consist of either two or five numeric digits. The supplemental 
        is simply a small additional bar code that is added onto the right side 
        of a standard UPC symbol.</p>

			

         

		
      <h1> <br>
        Differences between Type A and Type E</h1>
      <p>UPC-E is also called "zero suppressed UPC" because UPC-E compresses 
        a normal 12 digit UPC-A number into a six digit code by "suppressing" 
        the number system digit, trailing zeros in the manufacturers code and 
        leading zeros in the product identification part of the bar code message. 
        A seventh check digit is encoded into a parity pattern for the six main 
        digits. UPC-E can thus be uncompressed back into a standard UPC-A 12 digit 
        number.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Note:</b><br>
        Most bar code readers can be configured to automatically convert 6 digit 
        UPC-E numbers to 12 digit UPC-A numbers before they are transmitted to 
        a host computer.</p>
      <p>The main difference between a UPC-A symbol and a UPC-E symbol is the 
        size.&nbsp; Below is a UPC-A bar code on the left and the same data encoded 
        as a UPC-E symbol on the right. </p>

      <h1> EAN<a name="EAN"></a>-8 / EAN-13, BookLand and EAN Supplementals</h1>

		

			<h2>EAN-8/EAN-13 with supplemental (ISBN Version)</h2>

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/ean8" height="50" width="103"><img src="bcsymbol_files/ean13" height="63" width="172">

			

			<p>EAN or European Article Numbering system (also called JAN in

            Japan) is a European version of UPC. It uses the same size requirements and a similar

            encoding scheme as for UPC codes. </p>

			

            <p>

            EAN-8 encodes 8 numeric digits consisting of two country code digits, five data digits and

            one check digit. B-Coder will accept up to 7 numeric digits for EAN-8. B-Coder will

            automatically calculate the check digit for you. If you enter less than 7 digits or if you

            enter any digits other than 0 to 9, B-Coder will display a warning message. If the option

            "Enable Invalid Message Warnings" in the Preferences menu is not selected and

            you do not enter 7 digits, B-Coder will left pad short messages with zeros and truncate

            longer messages so that the total length is 7.</p>

		

			

           <p> EAN-13 is the European version of UPC-A. The difference between
             EAN-13 and UPC-A is that

            EAN-13 encodes a 13th digit into the parity pattern of the left six
             digits of a UPC-A

            symbol. This 13th digit, combined with the 12th digit, usually represent
             a country code.</p>

			<p>

            Both EAN-8 and EAN-13 support a supplemental two or five digit number to be appended to

            the main bar code symbol. The supplemental is designed for use on publications and

            periodicals. Supplemental messages must consist of either two or five numeric digits and

            will appear as a small additional bar code on the right side of a standard EAN symbol.</p>

            EAN bar code numbers are assigned to specific products and manufacturers by an

      <p> EAN-13 has been adopted as the standard in the publishing industry for 
        encoding ISBN numbers on books. An ISBN or BookLand bar code is simply 
        an EAN-13 symbol consisting of the first 9 digits of the ISBN number preceded 
        by the digits 978. The supplemental in an ISBN bar code is the retail 
        price of the book preceded by the digit 5. For example, if your ISBN number 
        is 1-56276-008-4 and the price of the book is $29.95 then you would enter 
        978156276008 as the bar code message and 52995 for the supplemental. </p>

      <h2>RSS-14<a name="RSS14"></a></h2>
      <p><img src="bcsymbol_files/rss14" height="86" width="154"></p>
      <p>RSS was developed by the <a href="http://www.uc-council.org/" target="_blank">Uniform
           Code Council</a>, Inc. to answer business needs of its 200,000 member
            companies in North America. The purpose of the code is to increase
           the 
        amount of information that can be put into a bar code while decreasing
            the overall area of the code. The code will allow businesses to improve
           
        the stream of information and to match that information to the actual
            flow of product. This type of code is particularly useful for applications
           
        where space limitations are a concern. Industries such as pharmaceutical,
            healthcare, logistics and transportation, and supermarkets have recently
           
        begun utilizing this new symbology. RSS allows businesses to go beyond
            the typical manufacturer and product identification information embedded
           
        in a bar code. The healthcare industry views this symbology as a potential
            way to significantly reduce medication errors. The RSS technology
           also 
        improves the labeling and tracking of food items. It gives supermarkets
            the opportunity to improve their labeling and tracking of meat and
           produce 
        items. The code can be encoded to include manufacturers name, item identification
            number, weight, extended price, and the ability to place "best if
           used 
        by" dates on items. Consumers also benefit by added consumer safety.
           If a bad batch of produce is placed on the shelves, a supermarket
           will
           have 
        the ability to track down the produce immediately and remove it from
           the  shelves. </p>

      <h2>CODABAR<a name="codabar"></a></h2>

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/codabar" height="50" width="135">

		  

			<p>CodaBar is a variable length symbology that allows encoding of

            the following 20 characters: 0123456789-$:/.+ABCD. CodaBar is commonly used in libraries,

            blood banks, and the air parcel business. CodaBar uses the characters A B C and D only as

            start and stop characters. Thus, the first and last digits of a CodaBar message must be A

            B C or D and the body of the message should not contain these characters. B-Coder will

            allow any length of CodaBar message as long as it contains valid characters and starts and

            ends with a valid start/stop character. If you use lower case letters for A B C or D,

            B-Coder will convert to upper case.</p>

      <p>Interleaved 2 of 5 is a high density variable length numeric only symbology 
        that encodes digit pairs in an interleaved manner. The odd position digits 
        are encoded in the bars and the even position digits are encoded in the 
        spaces. Because of this, I 2 of 5 bar codes must consist of an even number 
        of digits. Also, because partial scans of I 2 of 5 bar codes have a slight 
        chance of being decoded as a valid (but shorter) bar code, readers are 
        usually set to read a fixed (even) number of digits when reading I 2 of 
        5 symbols. The number of digits are usually pre-defined for a particular 
        application and all readers used in the application are programmed to 
        only accept I 2 of 5 bar codes of the chosen length. Shorter data can 
        be left padded with zeros to fit the proper length. </p>

			

            
      <p>Interleaved 2 of 5 optionally allows for a weighted modulo 10 check character 
        for special situations where data security is important. </p>

      <p>CODE 93 is a variable length symbology that can encode the complete
        128  ASCII character set. CODE 93 was developed as an enhancement to
        the Code 
        39 symbology by providing a slightly higher character density than Code
         39. CODE 93 also incorporates two check digits as an added measure of
        
        security. Although CODE 93 is considered more robust than Code 39, it
         has never achieved the same popularity as Code 39. CODE 93 bar codes
        are 
        framed by a special start/stop character. B-Coder will automatically
        add  the start and stop characters as well as the check digits to each
        CODE 
        93 bar code therefore you should not attempt to include them as part
        of  your bar code message. </p>

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/code128" alt="code128" height="50" width="136">

           

			
      <p>Code 128 is a variable length, high density, alphanumeric symbology. 
        Code 128 has 106 different bar and space patterns and each pattern can 
        have one of three different meanings, depending on which of three different 
        character sets is employed. Special start characters tell the reader which 
        of the character sets is initially being used and three special shift 
        codes permit changing character sets inside a symbol. One character sets 
        encodes all upper case and ASCII control characters, another encodes all 
        upper and lower case characters and the third set encodes numeric digit 
        pairs 00 through 99. This third character set effectively doubles the 
        code density when printing numeric data. Code 128 also employs a check 
        digit for data security. In addition to ASCII characters, Code 128 also 
        allows encoding of four special function codes (FNC1 - FNC4). The meaning 
        of function code FNC1 and FNC4 were originally left open for application 
        specific purposes. Recently an agreement was made by the Automatic Identification 
        Manufacturers Assoc. (AIM) and the European Article Numbering Assoc. (EAN) 
        to reserve FNC1 for use in EAN applications. FNC4 remains available for 
        use in closed system applications. FNC2 is used to instruct a bar code 
        reader to concatenate the message in a bar code symbol with the message 
        in the next symbol. FNC3 is used to instruct a bar code reader to perform 
        a reset. When FNC3 is encoded anywhere in a symbol, any data also contained 
        in the symbol is discarded. </p>

            <p>POSTNET (POSTal Numeric Encoding Technique) is a 5, 9 or 11 digit numeric only bar code

            symbology used by the U.S. Postal Service to encode ZIP Code information for automatic

            mail sorting by zip code. The bar code may represent a five digit ZIP Code (32 bars), a

            nine digit ZIP + 4 code (52 bars) or an eleven digit Delivery Point code (62 bars). 

			</p>

            
      <p>POSTNET is unlike other bar codes because data is encoded in the height 
        of the bars instead of in the widths of the bars and spaces. Most standard 
        bar code readers cannot decode POSTNET. This symbology was chosen by the 
        Postal Service mainly because it is extremely easy to print on almost 
        any type of printer. POSTNET is a fixed dimension symbology meaning that 
        the height, width and spacing of all bars must fit within exact tolerances.

            business and courtesy reply mail from other letters. Three FIM patterns are currently in

            use. FIM-A is used on courtesy reply mail that has been preprinted with PostNET bar codes.

            FIM-B is used on business reply, penalty and franked (government) mail that is not

            preprinted with PostNET bar codes. FIM-C is used on business reply, penalty and franked

            mail that has been preprinted with PostNET bar codes. FIM patterns are placed in the upper

			<img src="bcsymbol_files/pdf417" height="22" width="82"><br>

			

			<p>PDF417 is a high density 2 dimensional bar code symbology that essentially consists

            of a stacked set of smaller bar codes. The symbology is capable of encoding the entire

            (255 character) ASCII set. PDF stands for "Portable Data File" because it can

            encode as many as 2725 data characters in a single bar code. The complete specification

            for PDF417 provides many encoding options including data compaction options, error

            detection and correction options, and variable size and aspect ratio symbols. The

            symbology was published by Symbol Technologies, Inc. to fulfill the need for higher

            density bar codes. The low level structure of a PDF417 symbol consists of an array of code

            words (small bar and space patterns) that are grouped together and stacked on top of each

            other to produce the complete printed symbol. An individual code word consists of a bar

            and space pattern 17 modules wide. The user may specify the module width, the module

            height, and the overall aspect ratio (overall height to width ratio) for the complete

            symbol. A complete PDF417 symbol consists of at least 3 rows of up to 30 code words and

            may contain up to 90 code word rows per symbol with a maximum of 928 code words per

            symbol.</p>

			

			

            <p>The code words in a PDF417 symbol are generated using one of three data compaction modes

            currently defined in the symbology specifications. This allows more than one character to

            be encoded into a single data code word. Because different data compaction algorithms may

            be used, it is possible for different printed symbols to be created from the same input

            data. The symbology also allows for varying degrees of data security or error correction

            and detection. Nine different error correction levels are available with each higher level

            adding additional overhead to the printed symbol.</p>

            <img src="bcsymbol_files/pbo" height="18" width="114"><br>

			

			<p>BPO (British Post Office) 4 State Code is a new postal bar code symbology that has

            been developed by the British Post office for encoding European postcode data similar to

            the way the U.S. PostNET symbology is used for encoding Zip Code data. At the time of this

            writing, the BPO 4 State Code has not been officially adopted as the standard for European

            postal applications however it is anticipated that it will be sanctioned sometime in 1995.

            The goal of BPO 4 State Code is to provide European countries with a simple and efficient

            postal bar coding scheme.</p>

			

            <p>The U.S. PostNET symbology encodes numeric characters in a pattern
              of four bars per

            character with each bar being either tall or short (i.e. two possible "states"

            for each bar). The U.S. technique thus allows for up to 16 different
            possible bar patterns

            for each set of four bars and is adequate for encoding the ten digits
            zero through nine.

            Because European postcodes contain both alpha and numeric characters,
            (thus requiring a

            minimum of 36 different possible patterns for the characters A-Z
            and 0 to 9), each

            character in the BPO 4 State Code is encoded into four bars with
            each bar having four

            possible "states". The four states are: tall bars, short
            bars, medium height

            bars extended up from the middle of the symbol and medium height
            bars extended down from

            the middle of the symbol. In theory, the BPO 4 State Code is capable
            of encoding up to 128

            different characters however only the characters A through Z and
            0 to 9 have been assigned

            unique bar patterns.</p>

			

           
            <p> BPO 4 State Code is a fixed dimension symbology meaning that the height, 
        width and spacing of all bars must fit within exact tolerances. </p>

        around the perimeter of the bar code symbol.</p>

            

			
      <p>There are two types of Data Matrix symbols each using a different error 
        checking and correction scheme (ECC). The different types of Data Matrix 
        symbols are identified using the terminology "ECC" followed 
        by a number representing the type of error correction that is used by 
        the encoding software. ECC 000 to ECC 140 are the original type of Data 
        Matrix symbols and are now considered obsolete. The newest version of 
        Data Matrix is called ECC 200 and is recommended for all new Data Matrix 
        applications. The ECC 200 version of Data Matrix uses a much more efficient

      <p>MaxiCode is a fixed size matrix style symbology which is made up of offset 
        rows of hexagonal modules arranged around a unique bulls-eye finder pattern. 
        Each MaxiCode symbol has 884 hexagonal modules arranged in 33 rows with 
        each row containing up to 30 modules. The maximum data capacity for a 
        MaxiCode symbol is 93 Alphanumeric characters or 138 Numeric characters. 
        The symbology was designed by United Parcel Service for package tracking 
        applications. The design of the MaxiCode symbology was chosen because 
        it is well suited to high speed, orientation independent scanning. Although 
        the capacity of a MaxiCode symbol is not as high as other matrix style 
        bar code symbologies, it was primarily designed to encode address data 
        which rarely requires more than about 80 characters. MaxiCode symbols 
        actually encode two separate messages - a Primary message and a Secondary 
        message. The Primary message normally encodes a postal code, a 3 digit 
        country code and a 3 digit class of service number. The Secondary message 
        normally encodes address data and any other required information.</p>

			<p>Aztec Code is a high

            density 2 dimensional matrix style bar code symbology that can encode
			  up to 3750

            characters from the entire 256 byte ASCII character set. The symbol
			  is built on a square

            grid with a bulls-eye pattern at its center. Data is encoded in a
			  series of

            "layers" that circle around the bullseye pattern. Each
            additional layer

            completely surrounds the previous layer thus causing the symbol to
            grow in size as more

            data is encoded yet the symbol remains square. Aztec's primary features
            include: a wide

            range of sizes allowing both small and large messages to be encoded,
            orientation

            independent scanning and a user selectable error correction mechanism.</p>

			

          

			<p>The smallest element in an Aztec symbol is called a

            "module" (i.e. a square dot). The module size and the amount of error correction

            are the only "dimensions" that can be specified for an Aztec symbol and both are

            user selectable. It is recommended that the module size should range between 15 to 30 mils

            in order to be readable by most of the scanners that are currently available. </p>

			

         

			<p>The overall size of an Aztec symbol is dependent on the

            module size, the total amount of encoded data and also on the level of error correction

            capacity chosen by the user. The smallest Aztec symbol is 15 modules square and can encode

            up to 14 digits with 40% error correction. The largest symbol is 151 modules square and

            can encode 3000 characters or 3750 numeric digits with 25% error correction.</p>

         is one of the earliest bar code symbologies ever developed and is based
        
        on a four bit binary number scheme. Each symbol is framed by a start
        and  a stop pattern and contains a check character that is calculated
        from 
        the values of each of the encoded data digits. MSI/Plessey is rarely
        used  in anything other than grocery store shelf marking applications.
        In fact 
        most modern bar code readers do not provide support for reading MSI/Plessey
         symbols.</p>

      <h2><a name="Accuracy"></a>Accuracy of Different Symbologies - How Accurate 
        is Accurate?</h2>
      <p>It's commonly known that the best-trained data entry operator will make
         a keystroke entry error once every 300 keystrokes. Each of these keystroke
        
        errors represents an error in your decision-making data. This leads to
         wasted time, misappropriated capital and ultimately, lost revenues.
        It 
        is for this reason that most companies make the decision to adopt AIDC
         technologies.</p>
      <p>In studies conducted by the University of Ohio, common bar code symbologies 
        were tested to determine real life accuracy. The worst bar code for data 
        accuracy in the test proved to be one of the most common - the UPC. The 
        UPC had a worst-case error rate of 1 error in 394K characters. The best-tested 
        symbologies were the DataMatrix and PDF417, with a worst case error rate 
        of 1 error in 10.5M characters. All the results from the University of 
        Ohio study are listed below.</p>
