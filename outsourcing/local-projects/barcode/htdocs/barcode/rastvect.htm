<p>A bar code is comparable to a printed version of the Morse code. Instead of
  dots

        and dashes to represent characters, bar codes use the widths of black
  bars and white

        spaces. It is extremely important that the widths of the bars and spaces
  are printed

        within precise tolerances in order to be readable by most bar code readers.
  How the bar

        code is produced including the type of graphic that is originally used
  is therefore

        extremely important. Microsoft Windows supports three native graphic
  types that are

        commonly used to create bar codes: bitmaps, fonts and metafiles. </p>

		

		

		  <h2>BitMaps</h2>

		  

            <p>A bitmap is an array of dots or "pixels" where each
              pixel (picture element) has

            a value that represents the color of the pixel. The width of a bitmap
              is defined by the

            number of pixels across a row. The height of the bitmap is defined
              by the number of rows

            of pixels. Any graphic that is made up of rows of dots is called
              a "Raster"

            graphic therefore a bitmap is a raster graphic. The overall printed
            dimensions of a bitmap

            are dependent on the dot resolution of the device used to print it.
            For example if you

            create a bitmap graphic that is 300 pixels wide and has 300 rows
            of pixels and then you

            print this bitmap on a printer that has a dot resolution of 300 dots
            per inch, you will

            end up with a printed image one inch square. If you display the same
            bitmap on a computer

            screen that has a dot resolution of 100 dots per inch, you end up
            with an image that is

            three inches square. This means that bitmaps are "device dependent" where
            the

            resolution of the rendering device (e.g. printer or screen) must
            be taken into

            consideration when you create the image. If you need to preserve
            the size of an image from

            one device to another (e.g. screen to printer) you must "stretch" or

            "shrink" a bitmap to fit the desired size. The process
            of stretching and

            shrinking involves either adding or removing pixels to or from the
            original image. As you

            can imagine resizing a bitmap to a desired size when moving from
            one output device to

            another generally causes a severe degradation of the original image
            quality. Therefore,

            when creating precise graphics (like bar codes) it is extremely important
            that the image

            is created with the same dot resolution of the printer. If you do
            not know the dot

            resolution of the printer that will be used to print the bar code
            then you cannot fully

            guarantee that the image will be readable by all bar code readers.<br>

            <br>

            A type of bitmap called a "Device Independent Bitmap" has been developed as an

            attempt to solve the device dependency problem however you still end up with distorted

            images when you render a bitmap on a device that does not have the exact same dot

            resolution that the bitmap was created with.<br>

            <br>

            Another problem with bitmaps is that they require large amounts of memory. For example a

            bitmap that is 300 pixels wide and 300 lines down (only 1 square inch on a 300 DPI laser

            printer) and has three bytes per pixel of color information (standard RGB colors) will

            require 270,000 bytes of memory or disk space. For bar codes, this is a huge amount of

            space for a very simple graphic made up of a relatively small number of rectangles.</p>

        

		<h2>Fonts</h2>

		

            
      <p>Although fonts are not normally thought of as graphics, they can be used 
        to produce bar codes. A font is a collection of graphic elements that 
        are assigned to each of the characters in the ASCII or ANSI character 
        set. Because most bar code symbologies encode data by mapping specific 
        characters to specific bar and space patterns, it is possible to use fonts 
        to create bar codes. Unfortunately, fonts have many inherent problems 
        when they are used to create bar codes. <br>
        <br>
        The most important problem with fonts when they are used to create bar 
        codes is that they are not "intelligent". Almost every bar code 
        symbology has features like start and stop patterns, check digits, guard 
        patterns, quiet zones and bearer bars. When you use a font to create a 
        bar code you cannot simply select the text for the message that you want 
        encoded and select a bar code font. You first have to insert special characters 
        for the start and stop patterns as well as manually calculate and insert 
        a special character for the check digit. In almost all cases you have 
        to use a special program provided with the font to calculate and add check 
        digits and insert start and stop patterns. Another problem with fonts 
        is that they cannot be scaled in a single direction in most application 
        programs. Some specialized desktop publishing programs allow stretching 
        of fonts in a single direction however most database or word processing 
        programs do not. This means that if you increase the size of a font, both 
        the height and the width change. When creating bar codes, it is extremely 
        important that the width of the bars and spaces remain constant. Typically 
        the height of a bar code font is not adequate and it must be scaled up. 
        When you do this by increasing the font size, the width of the bars and 
        spaces as well as the overall width of the bar code increases proportionally 
        which causes the bar code to be rendered out of spec. In general fonts 
        are the poorest choice for creating bar codes. They offer the least control 
        of all possible methods for creating bar codes.</p>

			

			<p>"Bar code fonts have been known to create EAN/UPC

            symbols with serious quality defects. The problems may be caused by the inherent design of

            the font, operator input, or a combination of both..." 

			Uniform Code Council, Inc., Guidelines for Providers of EAN/UPC

            Symbol Design Software, 1997, Page 13.</p>

			

			<p>"For these reasons, extreme caution should

            be used when producing EAN/UPC symbols with bar code fonts. They should only be used by

            highly experienced bar code design professionals utilizing appropriate

            controls"&nbsp; </p>

			

            <p>This is true when using fonts to create any bar code symbology.</p>

		  

		 <h2> Metafiles</h2>

			<p>The absolute best way to create bar codes is to use a vector style

            graphic. Instead of containing an actual raster style image (like a bitmap), a vector

            graphic contains a sequence of drawing instructions that describe how to render the image.

            For example it might contain an instruction that tells the output device to move to a

            point exactly two inches down and to the right from the upper left corner of the screen or

            page and draw solid black rectangle that is exactly a quarter of an inch wide and one inch

            tall.<br>

            <br>

            The Windows metafile (WMF) and the Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) graphics formats are

            "vector" graphic formats. The prominent features of the WMF format is that it is

            completely device independent, it supports extremely precise dimensions for all graphic

            elements (down to 1/100th of a millimeter) and the amount of memory required to store a

            metafile is extremely small. Best of all, every printer that has a Windows printer driver

            must support printing metafiles therefore there is never an issue with being able to print

            metafiles on a particular printer. The characteristics of metafiles are ideal for creating

            bar codes.<br>

            <br>

            As an added bonus, most programming languages and commonly used Windows
            programs provide

            built in support for handling metafiles. Metafiles are in fact built
            from the natural

            "graphics language" used by Windows for creating almost
            all graphic elements

            used in every Windows program. Windows also provides built in clipboard
            support for the

            metafile format which makes it extremely easy to move them between
            applications.<br>

            <br>

            The only problems that you might encounter with metafiles is that some service bureaus

            have trouble printing them on a small number of high resolution film mastering devices.

            Typically the problems that they encounter are because they are using older, outdated

            printer drivers. Service bureaus generally prefer the EPS graphics however most Windows

            programs do not have the ability to render EPS images on screen making EPS files difficult

            to work with. For example PageMaker for Windows will allow you to insert EPS files into a

            document however when you do so, PageMaker only displays a rectangle where the image would

            appear in the document. You will not see the image on your screen unless the EPS file has

            a TIFF preview embedded in the EPS file. (A TIFF is a type of raster graphic similar to a

            bitmap. Both EPS and WMF files can contain raster images embedded as part of the vector

            graphic.)</p>

			

			<h2>B-Coder

            Pro and B-Coder Lite</h2>

			

           <p>TALtech's B-Coder bar code graphic generating software can create
             bar codes in ANY graphic

            format - including Windows Metafile (.WMF), EPS, TIFF, bitmap, GIF,
             JPEG, AI, PCT, PCX,

            etc... However for the reasons given above we recommend that you
             use one of the vector

            formats (WMF or EPS) if possible.</p>

			  

			<h2>  Windows Applications</h2>

			   <p>- Word, Access,

                PageMaker, WordPerfect, Quark, etc.<br>

                Generally in Windows the WMF format is best as all printers can print perfect WMF graphics

                from Windows however only postscript printers can print EPS (Encapsulated Postscript)

                graphics. Hence WMF is the "default" graphic format in B-Coder.</p>

           

			  <h2>MAC</h2>

				<p>If you are going to be printing from a MAC we recommend you use the EPS graphic

                format in B-Coder. This allows all EPS options including selectable TIFF preview for the

                EPS.</p>

				

             

			<h2>  Internet</h2>

			  

              <p>  If you are going to be showing the bar codes on web pages then you will want to use the

                GIF or JPEG options, however the quality of these bar codes will be much lower as GIFs and

                JPEGs are raster graphics.</p>

			

			<p>The other graphic formats supported by B-Coder (bitmap, TIFF,

            PCT, PCX, TGA, CTM, WPG, DRW, etc.) are provided for special situations
			  or for specific

            applications that have limited graphic support. They are all raster
			  graphics so they

            should only be used if you have no other choice.</p>
