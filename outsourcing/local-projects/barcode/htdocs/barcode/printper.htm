    <td width="570"><img src="printper_files/r_printperf" alt="Printing Perfect Bar Codes From ANY Printer" border="0" height="17" width="319"> 
      <p>Printing 100% compliant barcodes from any printer to any label or document 
        will ensure perfect readability. With good quality label printers with 
        built-in barcode support this is usually possible as long as you carefully 
        follow the manufacturer's quality control directions. But good thermal 
        printers can cost several thousand dollars and are only designed for label 
        printing. What about printing from general purpose printers, such as laser 
        printers? In this case the software used is critical to guarantee perfect 
        barcodes.<br>
        <br>
        The guidelines below are based on the industry standard recommendations 
        of the Uniform Code Council for EAN/UPC symbols but the concepts apply 
        equally well to all barcode symbologies.<br>
        <br>
        As a user it is important to understand these concepts in selecting the 
        best hardware and software for barcode printing. </p>
      <h2>Thermal Transfer Bar Code Label Printers</h2>
      <p> These are commonly used printers for barcode labeling. It is most important 
        with this type of printer to make sure that you follow the manufacturer&#8217;s 
        recommendations for setting up the printer and testing the bar codes. 
        Direct thermal and thermal transfer printers require specific settings 
        for best results depending on the combination of label and ribbon materials. 
        The manufacturer will supply the directions for the correct adjustment 
        for your printer type.<br>
        <br>
        It is also very important to verify bar codes using an ANSI based verifier.
         This should be done after any change in the label material or any change
        
        in the printer or it's settings. It should also be done or a regular
        basis to ensure quality is maintained and when printing a long run.<br>
        <br>
        To maintain the quality of printed bar codes the manufacturer&#8217;s directions 
        for cleaning the print head and guide surfaces should be followed. It 
        will also be necessary to replace the thermal printhead eventually as 
        these wear out. When this happens the bar codes will no longer be readable 
        as one or more of the dot elements will not heat properly. <br>
        <br>
        It is so important to verify printed symbols on a regular basis that some 
        thermal printers can be equipped with on-line verifiers.<br>
        <br>
        With thermal printers the quality of the label design software you use
         will not affect the quality of the printed bar codes.This is because
        the 
        software is just sending a command to print a bar code - a command that
         triggers the printer&#8217;s internal software to actually generate and
          print the correct bar code.</p>
      <h2> General Purpose Printers</h2>
      <p>General purpose printers, especially laser printers, are excellent for
         producing bar code labels on sheets of pre-cut labels (such as "Avery" 
        labels) or on continuous feed labels. Obviously, for anyone needing extremely
         high quantities of bar codes on a daily basis thermal transfer printers
        
        with their high speed would be better, but for many users general purpose
         printers, especially laser printers, are preferable. <br>
        <br>
        Laser printers are also perfect for creating bar codes on documents, such 
        as medical and legal records, coded "mail-merge" letters, etc. 
        Imagesetters, such as Linotronic printers, are used to create high quality, 
        2540+ dpi, film positives and negatives for commercial printing. <br>
        <br>
        With general purpose printers, including laser, desktop, ink jet, ion
         deposition, dot matrix and imagesetter, the software used is critical
        
        to ensuring readable symbols.</p>
      <p> "There is a wide variety of software packages for creating symbols 
        using general purpose printers. Unfortunately, many of these packages 
        are capable of producing symbols with totally unacceptable quality." 
      </p>
      <h1>UCC Guidelines for Producing Quality Symbols, April 1998</h1>
      <p>The software used should be able to satisfy the following requirements:</p>
      <h2>Dots Per Bar Width</h2>
      <p>When specifying the narrow bar (module) width the user should be able
         to specify an integer multiple of the printer dot width. This is best
        
        explained with an example. For a 600 dpi printer the actual dot width
        is  1/609.6* = 0.00164". The module width should be specified as
        an integer  multiple of printer dots, i.e. <br>
        8 dots per module gives a width of 13.12 Mils and a Magnification Factor 
        of 100.95%<br>
        7 dots per module gives a width of 11.48 Mils and a Magnification Factor 
        of 88.33%.</p>
      <p> (*A 600 dpi printer with an actual 609.6 dpi) <br>
        <img src="printper_files/print-bc3" height="76" width="200"><br>
        Module (bar) width defined as 8 printer dots or 13.12 Mils or a Magnification 
        Factor of 100.95%</p>
      <p>Module (bar) width defined as 13 Mils or a Magnification Factor of 100%. 
        This is not an Integer number of printer dots. Rounding errors could occur 
        when printing.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to achieve the correct module width for your printer 
        is to have software that:</p>
      <p><b>i.</b> Allows you to specify the target printer resolution or finds 
        the resolution for you for the printer you have selected.</p>
      <p><b>ii.</b> Then allows you to specify the module width in "printer 
        dots" (it would already know the "dots per inch"). You 
        would select the number of printer dots that most closely matches the 
        Magnification Factor, or module width in Mils, that you desire. If you 
        wanted 100% magnification an "8 printer dot" width for a 600 
        dpi printer would be the closest.</p>
      <h2> Bar Width Reduction</h2>
      <p> The software you select also needs to have an option for "Bar Width 
        Reduction." This is important when printing to any printer that has 
        "dot spread". This includes ink jet printers and "wet ink" 
        printers (but not laser printers). For these printers one dot of bar width 
        reduction is recommended per bar width. For instance for a 300 dpi ink 
        jet printer with a module width of 13.12 Mils (4 printer dots per module 
        width) Bar Width Reduction of one dot would be 3.28 Mils or 25%.<br>
        <br>
        Bar Width Reduction is also required when bar codes are going to be printed 
        on a commercial (wet ink) press. In this case the artwork containing the 
        bar code is usually output on film from an Imagesetter. Imagesetters have 
        resolutions of 2400+ dpi so the required bar width reduction can be specified 
        exactly. The actual amount of reduction required is determined by the 
        paper and ink used and this should be specified by the printer. If printing 
        to a smooth hard surface, such as a glass bottle, Bar Width Gain may be 
        required. Again, you should consult your commercial printer for his recommendations 
        before generating the bar codes. </p>
      <h2> Bar Code Graphic Type</h2>
      <p> <b><i>There are 3 main types of bar code software products:</i><br>
        <br>
        1.Bar Code Fonts</b><b><br>
        2.Bit-map (Raster) Bar Code Generators <br>
        3.Vector Bar Code Generators <br>
        <br>
        <i>Each is discussed below:</i></b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>1 Bar Code Fonts</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"Bar code fonts have been known to create EAN/UPC symbols 
            with serious design defects. The problems may be caused by the design 
            of the font, an operator input, or a combination of both."</i><br>
            <br>
            <font size="-1">UCC Guidelines for Providers of EAN/UPC Symbol Design 
            Software, July 1997.</font> <br>
          </p>
          <p><i>"Extreme caution should be used when producing EAN/UPC symbols 
            with bar code fonts." </i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><a href="http://www.uc-council.org/" target="_blank">The Uniform Code 
          Council</a> does not recommend the use of fonts. As problems it cites 
          in particular the ability to manipulate the size of individual characters 
          (distortion), spacing between the characters (kerning) and the possibility 
          of font or resolution substitution at the output stage. However there 
          are many other problems with bar code fonts. The user cannot specify 
          the module (bar) width exactly in printer dots. Fonts do not support 
          Bar Width Reduction. Nor do they support many of the features specific 
          to bar code symbols such as Bearer Bars, Quiet Zones, independent symbol 
          height and module (bar) width specification, symbol rotation and support 
          for binary data (including ACSII nulls in Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 
          and PDF 417). In addition, most fonts do not automatically calculate 
          and add check digits and other security features to bar codes. </p>
        <p> <b>2 Bitmap Bar Code Generators</b></p>
        <p> A bitmap image is device dependent. This means a bitmap of a one
           inch square to be printed at 300 dpi would be 300 pixels across by
          300 
          pixels down. If a bar code designed to print one inch square on a 300
           dpi printer were printed instead on a 600 dpi printer the resulting
          
          bar code would be ½ inch x ½ inch. This is because there would only
           be 300x300 pixels in the image instead of 600x600.<br>
          <br>
          The other problem with bitmap images is their size. If you are printing
           to a 200 dpi printer a one inch square would contain 200 x 200 =40,000
          
          bits of data. This is bad enough but to a higher resolution printer,
           such as a common 600 dpi printer it would be 360,000 bits of data
          (and 
          6.5 million bits of data for a 2540 dpi Imagesetter!!). These huge
          files  not only use large amounts of computer memory they also print
          extremely 
          slowly.</p>
        <p> <b>3 Vector Bar Code Generators</b></p>
        <p> Vector graphics are perfect for defining bar code images. A vector 
          image is a set of drawing commands that precisely defines the edges 
          of each bar and specifies how to fill in the area created within the 
          defined edges.<br>
          <br>
          Vector images are completely device independent as they are a set of 
          precise commands instead of a collection of dots. A 1" x 1" 
          box will print 1" by 1" on a 100, 600 or 2540 dpi printer! 
          When a vector image is sent to a general printer the printer&#8217;s 
          software converts it to a raster image so that it can print it. The 
          Raster Image Processor in the Printer converts the precise path commands 
          in the vector graphic into a series of pixels. Hence the exact measurements 
          of the image are influenced by the resolution of the printer. A higher 
          resolution printer will be able to more precisely match the exact measurements 
          of the vector graphic. A lower resolution printer will need to round 
          the dimensions to the nearest integer number of printer dots. This is 
          why it is so important, especially in printers of 600 dpi or less, to 
          specify the module (bar) width in integers of printer dots (see part 
          1 above).<br>
          <br>
          Vector bar code graphics are also much smaller than other bar code graphics 
          so they print many, many times faster. For instance, a typical 1" 
          high UPC code at 100% magnification would create a 149 KB bitmap for 
          a 600 dpi printer. A Windows Metafile (WMF) vector graphic of this bar 
          code would be 2 KB and an Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) vector graphic 
          with a TIFF preview would be 48 KB and 29 KB without the TIFF preview. 
          Windows Metafiles (WMF) are the best graphic format for bar codes in 
          Windows and EPS in the Mac (Macs do not support WMF graphics).<br>
          <br>
          Once the bar code is created by any bar code software it should not 
          be resized, scaled or stretched. If the bar code is to be transferred 
          to a second party, information, such as the minimum printer resolution 
          for that bar width, should be communicated.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h1>Bar Code Verification</h1>
      <p>As with Thermal Transfer printers, it is important to test the output 
        from General Purpose printers using a bar code verifier. The UCC recommends 
        using the test symbols:<br>
        <br>
        0 12345 01234 1<br>
        <br>
        6 78912 56789 0<br>
        <br>
        If they fall below a grade B check that you have specified a Magnification 
        Factor (or module width) that corresponds to an integer number of printer 
        dots per module (bar) width. Bar Width Reduction may also be required 
        as discussed above.<br>
        <br>
        If the user does not have a bar code verifier he can submit the bar codes 
        to a qualified testing organization. If nothing else, at least they should 
        be tested with a bar code reader.</p>
