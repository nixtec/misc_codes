Interfacing a bar code reader to a PC:
All application programs support bar code reading as long as you have the
right equipment. Bar code readers are available with two types of output -
either "keyboard wedge" output or RS232 output. The bar code readers with
keyboard wedge output plug directly into the keyboard port on your PC and they
also provide a pigtail connector so that you can plug in your keyboard at the
same time.
